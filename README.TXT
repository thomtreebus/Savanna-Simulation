A simulation set in a savanna biome that involves different animal and plant species in
an enclosed rectangular field.


How to start:
    Using BlueJ:
        Create a Simulator object.
        Then call one of:
            + simulateOneStep - for a single step.
            + simulate - and supply a number (say 10) for that many steps.
            + runLongSimulation - for a simulation of 500 steps.
    Using a different IDE:
        Run the main method in the Simulator class,
        this will call the method runLongSimulation - for a simulation of 500 steps.
